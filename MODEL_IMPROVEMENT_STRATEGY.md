# Antibody Generation Model Improvement Strategy

**Project**: Epitope-to-Antibody Generation Pipeline
**Current Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Production-ready baseline established

## Executive Summary

Your current model successfully generates structurally valid antibodies (mean pRMSD: 1.79 Å) with literature-validated epitopes (20 citations per target). However, before experimental synthesis, several critical improvements are needed to maximize success rate and minimize cost.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Antibody generation: 100% sequence validity
- ✅ Structure prediction: Good quality (IgFold validated)
- ✅ Literature validation: Real API integrations (PubMed, PDB)
- ⚠️ Epitope prediction: Placeholder (not validated)
- ⚠️ Affinity prediction: Uncalibrated (pKd conditioning unknown accuracy)
- ❌ Binding validation: No experimental data yet

**Goal**: Achieve >50% binding detection rate and <1 log unit affinity prediction error before scaling to multiple viruses.
