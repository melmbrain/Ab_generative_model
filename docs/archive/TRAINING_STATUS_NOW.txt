CURRENT TRAINING STATUS
========================================

Started:  15:58 (4:58 PM)
Current:  16:12 (4:12 PM)
Runtime:  14 minutes

Model:    small (5.6M parameters)
Config:   --config small --batch-size 32 --device cuda
Name:     production_small_v1
PID:      8862

========================================
GPU STATUS
========================================

Utilization:  97% ✅
VRAM Usage:   2.9 GB / 6.0 GB ✅
Temperature:  83°C ✅
Status:       TRAINING ACTIVELY

========================================
ESTIMATED PROGRESS
========================================

Based on timing (14 minutes):
  Estimated Epochs:  4-7 (out of 20)
  Progress:          ~25-35%
  Time Remaining:    ~40-50 minutes

Expected completion: ~16:45-17:00 (4:45-5:00 PM)

========================================
ISSUE: OUTPUT BUFFERING
========================================

Problem:
  - Python is buffering all output
  - No logs or checkpoints created yet
  - Can't see real-time progress

Evidence training is working:
  ✅ GPU at 97% for 14 minutes straight
  ✅ High CPU usage (134%)
  ✅ Process still running
  ✅ VRAM usage appropriate for model

All output will appear when training completes!

========================================
WHAT TO DO
========================================

NOW:
  - Training is running in background
  - You can close this terminal safely
  - Process will continue

CHECK BACK AT 4:45-5:00 PM (16:45-17:00):

Run these commands:

1. Check if training complete:
   ps aux | grep 8862

2. Check for results:
   python3 monitor_training.py logs/production_small_v1.jsonl

3. View checkpoints:
   ls -lh checkpoints/

4. Check log file:
   tail -100 training_live.log

========================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
========================================

When training completes, you'll see:

Checkpoints:
  checkpoints/production_small_v1_epoch1.pt
  checkpoints/production_small_v1_epoch2.pt
  ...
  checkpoints/production_small_v1_epoch[BEST].pt

Logs:
  logs/production_small_v1.jsonl

Output:
  All 20 epochs of training output in training_live.log

Best model will be automatically saved!

========================================
FINAL EXPECTED METRICS
========================================

After 20 epochs, expect:
  Train Loss:    1.6-2.0
  Val Loss:      1.7-2.1
  Validity:      95-100%
  Diversity:     75-85%

Total training time: ~50-70 minutes

========================================
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
========================================

Training stopped:
  - Check: ps aux | grep 8862
  - If not running, check training_live.log for errors

GPU not utilized:
  - Check: nvidia-smi
  - Should show 90-100% usage

Out of memory:
  - Check training_live.log for "CUDA out of memory"
  - Unlikely with small model (only uses 2.9 GB)

========================================
MONITORING COMMANDS
========================================

Check if running:
  ps aux | grep 8862

Check GPU:
  nvidia-smi

Check runtime:
  ps -p 8862 -o etime

View any output:
  tail -f training_live.log

========================================
NEXT CHECK: 4:45-5:00 PM
========================================

Come back around 16:45-17:00 (4:45-5:00 PM)
Training should be complete by then!

All results will be visible at that time.

========================================
